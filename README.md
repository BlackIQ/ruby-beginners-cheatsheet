# Ruby beginners cheatsheet

If you want to learn Ruby language, you need to have a cheatsheet that check stuff that you forget or check that is it right or not.

In this repository I wrote some basics of ruby and hope you use it!

## Advanced cheatsheet

I also created some advanced stuff that will be publish these days.

## Rails

Well, still these is no **Rails** tutorial but if you request I will create one!
